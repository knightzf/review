It's a dp problem, no question.

First try I thought it to be more complicated than it actually is and I mistakenly forgot the words have sequences.

Second try is more straight forward. After setting the initial values, the next question is to define dp[i][j].

It is actualy pretty simple, when s1[i] == s[j], it's the easiest.

Otherwise, find the min of two possibilities.
