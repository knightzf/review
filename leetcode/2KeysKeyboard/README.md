My solution is a N^2 dp solution, and I used static member to achieve speed.\
In discussion some people uses logN solution basically divide when possible and reduce to a smaller problem.\
Why it divides when possible? This is from oberservation that copy twice is cheaper than copy 3 times and etc.
