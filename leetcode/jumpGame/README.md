4/19\
Took me some time to figure this out.\
Tried dfs and bfs, both timed out.\
Realized it's a simpler problem than I expected.\
Yes it can jump to a future spot which cannot reach end.\
However we only to keep track of furthest reachable spot and see if next steps\
in this range can reach further.
