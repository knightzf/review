Using a hash table is nothing to talk about.\
Here the learned solution is to try to move numbers to positions they should be until it fails (swap duplicate numbers.)\
Then we can just check which position has number that we don't want, that is the duplicate, the one should be here\
is the missing one.

This is a great idea and it applies to a type of problems.\
Need a little thinking to make sense of it.
