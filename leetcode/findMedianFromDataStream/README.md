My solution is simple, use a map and keep track of the iterator to the middle item. It's a little tricky in the implementation details but nothing too difficult.

There's another solution from dicussion area where it's using to heaps (max heap and min heap) to store the largets and smallest half of the number.

Using two heaps we can have access to two middle numbers.
