This question is actually pretty tricky! Not that easy to find a solution.\\
Core idea:
* find the length of the number where the nth digit is from
* find the actual number where the nth digit is from
* find the nth digit and return

I struggled for long time and couldn't get it right.\
Besides the learned solution is so concise and beautiful!
