So it's a dfs but will time out without memorization.\
Since the input is small, I came up using bitmask as the state.\
Looked through discussion, there's dp basically using woker index and state bitmask, but it's hard to get that.\
Also there's solution using priority queue, also utilizing some bitmask state.

Seems to be an easy problem, but not as simple as it looks.
