Binary search, the only thing is it's possile the square of mid number is much larger than int.\
Need to change to division instead of multiplication.\
It seems fb likes to have such edge case questions.

4/19\
I spent like 30 minutes on this problem.\
Knew it's a binary search but took long time to get it right.\
Learned a solution that save candiates of result, because it can only gets larger.
