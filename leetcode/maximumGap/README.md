I thought for a while and fell asleep.

And had to check the discussion, the keyword bucket sort reminded me.

Sheng has talked to me about it before.

Idea is find min and max and then use bucket sort to put all numbers in their respective buckets.

The bucket size has to be chosen so that the max gap has to be larger than it.(i.e. if the diff between min and max is 10, and there are 3 elements, the max gap has >= 5)

The actual algo is simple but the idea is genius.
