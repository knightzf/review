I thought for a while and fell asleep.

And had to check the discussion, the keyword bucket sort reminded me.

Sheng has talked to me about it before.

Idea is find min and max and then use bucket sort to put all numbers in their respective buckets.

The bucket size has to be chosen so that the max gap has to be larger than it.(i.e. if the diff between min and max is 10, and there are 3 elements, the max gap has >= 5)

The actual algo is simple but the idea is genius.

Tried to do this problem again, sort of prepare for two sigma phone interview.\
It took me about an hour to figure out this is a bucket sort type solutions.\
I knew it's not a regular sorting cuz it won't be linear, but really hard to figure out the correct direction.\
However I got stuck at the bucket size and bucket number.\
My previous solution is actually better than my current in the sense that the bucket size can be a little smaller which is fine.\
And the bucket number isn't all that important either, it can be a little more than actually needed.
