The difficulty level is easy and it's not.\
I got stuck in the original question of how to find the poison in one shot, which is basically binary conversion.\
Now this is different, it wants to find minimum number of pigs.

It's easy to know how many times we can test and for n tests, it can actually test n + 1 buckets.\
Based on this idea, we can use each pig to test n + 1 buckets and now it becomes a geometry/encoding question.\
we tried to find one point in X dimension matrix and use 1 pig to test each dimension n times.\
This is very brilliant.
