My solution is very ugly which uses dfs.\
My idea is simple, the possible numbers are powers of 2, 3, 5, 7.\
5 and 7 can't have multiples but 2 and 3 can.\
How to know what multiple combinations yields min number? Use dfs.

The better solution is to try from 9 to 2, and fill in as many large number possible on lower digits.\
Yeah that's so simple and I didn't get it.\
This is when I got stuck to an idea and struggled to get a solution but it's not the right solution.\
Really need to understand the problem!
