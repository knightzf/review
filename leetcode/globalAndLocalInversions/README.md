This is that kind of question you need to understand what is actually needed.

In order to satisfy the requirement.

For each local reversion, the difference can only be 1.

Otherwise for example

7 5

In this case, whether 6 appears before 7 or after 5, it will create more global reversion.

Also it requires all numbers before the reversion must have been visited.

Otherwise for example

2 1 0

2 and 1 satisfies the 1 difference but 0 hasn't showed up which definitely will create another global reversion.
