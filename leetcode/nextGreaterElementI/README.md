My solution is too naive.\
Looked at discussion and there's stack based solution, \
I tried it out based on the idea,\
it starts from right (can start from left too) and push back numbers if it's smaller than top, otherwise pop until so.\
Then we can know the next bigger number on the right for each number.

I knew my solution wasn't good enough, this is indeed smart!
