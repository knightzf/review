The problem itself is trivial.

However in the discussion there's a better solution that uses two pointers, one to loop and the other to track the most significant index that is going to be increased.\
Then increase the most significant bit and from this bit to end of list to 0.

It's the typical one fast and one slow pointer approach.\
Lesson learned!
