This is a very good problem, it had little to do with the first question which is a binary search.\
Here we are looking for a min that starts from any point and max of two sub sets.

I first tried to find a greedy solution which fails, which leads me to believe we need to try all possibilities.\
Timedout solution is no surprise for recursion function.\
Then I added memorization to the problem and that's it!
