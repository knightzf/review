I feel very uncomfortable with this problem.\
It's a greedy solution which is hard to come up with, even you have an idea, how to prove it?\
My idea is to find longest sequences possible and for those that are shorter than 3, try to put them into long sequences.\
I still can't prove it's correct..

There is a brilliant solution that uses a hashmap to note the possible append numbers.
