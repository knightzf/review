My solution:\
1. first solution used intervals and use a random number to find which interval it falls into.\
2. second solution uses a map, similar idea, more efficient.

Learned solution:\
Map black list numbers to new numbers from end of range.\
Then if random number falls into black listed numbers, return the mapped. new number.\
This is really great and smart!
