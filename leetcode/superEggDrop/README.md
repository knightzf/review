I spent some time, only thought of a direct dp solution, which is a 2d N^2 solution, which is too slow given N can be\
as much as 10000.

Looked at other people's solution, the key idea is to change the problem into another perspective.\
Basically instead of trying to find given K eggs and N floors, we can think of given K eggs and M moves, what is the max\
number of floors we can measure? This relationship is also easy to get.

Hard problems often requires changing perspective which I am really weak of. Still have room to improve!
