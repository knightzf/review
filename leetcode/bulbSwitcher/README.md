The idea is the light will only be on when it's toggled odd times.

For any times, the toggle time is even because divisors come in pairs.\
e.g. 6 can be divided by 1, 6 and 2, 3

So only square numbers match the criteria.

How many square numbers are there?

int(sqrt(n)) is the largest square number, and there are 1, 2, 3 ...int(sqrt(n)) of them.

What a surprise!
