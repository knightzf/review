Problems worth revisiting:
753 math prob, de brujin sequence, otherwise just dfs
913 need assumption of finite 2*n steps, also tricky in result deduction
947 another type of count the islands, tricky to use union find
1066 dfs with memorization
1096 state maybe one ele or a list, premature union is bad(unlike calculator)
