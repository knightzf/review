The problem is really hard in how to determing the draw result.\
Draw is not a simple repeat of existing state, rather it's the optimal both parties can do.\
I tried DFS solution for a few nights but went nowhere.\
The learned solution is a toplogical sort type where it starts from known states.\
The key is still how to determine draw?\
It's those nodes cannot connect to a deterministic color.
