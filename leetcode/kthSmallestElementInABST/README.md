Non-recursive in order traversal of a bst isn't so easy.

I was right that I did changed the tree to traverse it.

In fact it's not needed.

Non-recursive post order traversal will be best to use two stacks.

Not great way if we need to find kth number frequently, otherwise just inorder\
traversal.
