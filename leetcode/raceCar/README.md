I had the observation that continuous n A will go 2^n - 2 distance, however I don't know how to use this information in a dp content.

Learned solution is simple, it goes to find position pass target and go backwards\
or\
it goes to last possible position before target and walk back 0, 1... n - 2 times before coming back towards target.

It passes the tests however I didn't find a proof that this is the right algoritm to solve it.\
Neither is the pruning in DFS methods albeilt they are much slower.

I spent almost half a day trying to understand it but i am not inteligent enough.
