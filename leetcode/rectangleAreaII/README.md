It's similar to skyline problem.\
No fancy quick solution.\
During contest I was trying a wrong algo which sums all rectanges and find overlapping areas to remove.\
However I quickly found areas with more than 2 rectanges coverage will be removed more that it should be.\
And it's hard to keep track of which areas are being overlapped by different pair of rectangles.\
Finally wrote out a long solution by myself 2 hours after contest.
