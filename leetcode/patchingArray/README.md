Speechless after seeing the discussion. The difference between two people can be day and night.

I would never think of such a solution.

The key is the observation below:\
If we have a range [1, m) meaning it covers from 1 to m-1\
Any number x in [1, m] can extend this range to [1, m + x)\
We should choose x to be m because it gives us maximal extension\
which is the key of a greedy solution
