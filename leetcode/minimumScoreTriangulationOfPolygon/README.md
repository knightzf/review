It took me very long time to come up with a ac solution which is far from good for a few reasons.\
1. Geometry problem is the kind I find difficult.\
2. It's very hard to extract the problem into a high level model and I dwelled on the details.\
3. Simple dfs times out.\
4. Tried a few greedy solutions, all failed.

The solution from discussion is similar to my idea but I was thinking of adding a new point to exsting points.\
The solution breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, avoiding the extra calcs my algo needs.
