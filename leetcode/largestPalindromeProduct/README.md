I thought for long time and couldn't find a clue.\
It turns there is no smart solution but even for non-smart solution, there's smart idea.\
For size n number, there's a range of possible numbers.\
How to find palindrome product from max to min?\
Use number from max to min to construct a palindrome product by taking a mirror view.\
This gurantees the palindrome also goes from max to min.\
Then we just need to find if the product can be divided by some number in the range.
