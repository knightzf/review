It's very similar to quick sort.

I've forgotten the partition algo. So basically it uses last element as pivot value and loop through the array and in the end swap the pivot with first element that is >= pivot.

The code is a little tricky, more tricky than quick sort as we only care about\
the kth element, so we need to make sure the pivot number is at correct pos\
at the end of the partition code.
