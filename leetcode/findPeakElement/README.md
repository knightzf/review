This is really stupid question.
It only needs to find any peak not the global peak.

5/19\
I didn't know the problem was looking for log(n) solution.\
Thought for a while and realized binary search can be used here.\
It's because if the mid number doesn't satisfy the requirement,\
such result will definitely exist on the larger side.
