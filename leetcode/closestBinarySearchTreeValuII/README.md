This is a great idea.

The author really uderstands traverse.

In order traversal returns in order result.

Reverse inorder traversal returns reverse order result.

So the idea is to travese in two ways and stop when they see target, use to stacks to store the values during traversal.

After that it's a simple merge sort.
