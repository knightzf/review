To rotate a square matrix, basically rotate from outer most circle into internal circles.

The only tricky part is to figure out the indices of element to rotate.

Tried to solve it by swapping individual cell, which is hard to write and hard\
to get right.\
Checked my previous solution, it defines 4 points around the square which works.\
This time I figured out a solution, basically do a mirror swap then swap each row.\
Kudos to myself.
