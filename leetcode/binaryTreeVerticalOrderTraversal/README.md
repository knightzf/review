Tried this problem again using in order traversal.\
The hard part is that the output order is from left to right and from top to bottom.\
During the traversal, I have to put each node into correct bucket by using extra depth and idx information.\
And in the end, I need to do some processing to sort them into correct order.\
Used some stl algorithms that should be cleaner but actually seems to be harder to read albeilt less lines.
