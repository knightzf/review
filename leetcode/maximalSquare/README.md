Similar to one of the matrix questions, scan the matrix and check consecutive 1s from left and up.

Then go over again with the data to find max square size.

3/26\
My second solution is more like the historgram problem.\
However it's not very efficient to find the max square at each historgram point

Here is a very good solution using dp, the dp transition formula is hard to get without looking at the answer\
