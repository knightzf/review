The acceptance is so low, I thought it's a very hard question.

Turns out not that hard at all.

4/4\
I didn't know the standard implementation is to use a hashmap with a doubly linked list.\
Thought for long time but couldn't find a good way to store the two way mapping form hashmap to list.\
Finally saw the discussion and they put iterator in the hashmap.\
It makes sense now and I got to learn more about std::list and its iterator.
