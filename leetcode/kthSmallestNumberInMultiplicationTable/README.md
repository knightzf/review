I thought for a few days about this problem.\
The main issue is I don't want to do a for loop of each row of the multiplication table.\
However it turns out there's no other way.

The idea is still binary search, for a given number, what is the rank of all the numbers?
Adjust the range after each iteration.

But anyway I'm glad I managed to figure out the solution myself.
