Tried DFS solution first, which times out, no surprise.\
Then thought of BFS and did one step a time, which gives incorrect results.\
Realized it has to go multiple steps until it stops, then how to stop at minimum step it reaches target?\
Then I thought of using priorit queue, then why not just use a map?
It turns out to be a valid solution.
