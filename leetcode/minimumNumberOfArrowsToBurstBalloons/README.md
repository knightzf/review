I think it's worth writing down the idea.\
It looks like the meeting room question however slightly different.\
In order to burst all balloons, each balloons needs to be popped.\
i.e. each balloon must have an arrow in its range\
So the solution is a greedy one, at each balloon, check its right neighbors to see if they can also be popped at the same time.\
The little trick is to adjust the window each time it looks at a new neighbor.
