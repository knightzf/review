Similiar to the 3sum question. With N^3 complexity.

It's not optimized as there's no pruning of the loops. Also it's a bit tricky to avoid duplicate in result, I am using a set in this solution, believe there's better ways.

4/19\
It's build on top of 3sum and it can be refactored to generalized to N sum.
