I don't know when I did this problem last time but the runtime was off the chart slow..

Did it again, break into two sub problems\
* max increasing subarray len at each index
* count of such subarray at each index

Looked at discussion and was same idea.

Second time I took a simpler approach, basically a O(N^2) solution.\
Tried to think of a smart solution such as sliding window however doesn't seem to have such a way.
