Spent too much time on this problem.

1. First thought it's a geometry problem, have to use sin cos to find each contact point and etc.\
2. Realized that's probably way too difficult, tried to find pattern in it.\
3. After long thought and drawings, there doesn't seem to be a simple pattern.\
4. I tried to think of extending the size of the grid, which doesn't seem to work either.\
5. The problem was it was hard to calculate each contact point coordinates especially it can touch all 4 mirrors and it can change direction and etc.\
6. After seeing there was over 60% user success in submitting the answer I knew it can't be that complicated.\
7. Finally I found this trick that you don't need to consider the horizontal case because it'll reflect back to the vertical mirros.\
8. And it's very easy to calculate height due to the symmetry if the reflection touches horizontal mirros.\
9. One thing was unclear to me was it gurantees it will be received by one of them given it's also possibe to touch the start point.\
10. So in my program the check of whether it touches start point was ignored I guess it was implied.

This is a saturday contest problem and I spent almost one hour on this as this is really unseen before.\
It was hard to take it as a programming problem but I am glad that I finally figured out by myself.
