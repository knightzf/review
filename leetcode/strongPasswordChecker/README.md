I only thought about bfs type solution, which is definitely not very efficient.\
Looking at discussions, all seem extremely messy and was about to give up.\
Saw a much cleaner solution, like water in a dessert.

All the solutions are greedy methods and it's not straightforward to see why it works.\
I have comments in the code which should be easy to understand.
