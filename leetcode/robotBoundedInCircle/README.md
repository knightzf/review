This problem is actually not that easy.\
I first tried to see if L R can cancel out, yes they can but it's not that simple.\
In the end had to actually calculate the direction after instructions.\
I realized that if after one set of instructions, the direction changed, then it means it will change direction\
again in the next iteration, which means essentially it's going in a loop, maybe not a perfect one.\
Also need to check if a special case when it returns to the origin which is clearly a loop.
