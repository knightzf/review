Call me slow, it took me some thinking to figure out the answer.

It appears to be a very hard question, n numbers in some order to produce k unique diffs with neighbor element.

But if we make the k unique diffs 1 to k, then it seems k+1 and 1 produces the larges diff, then k and 1 produces the next, k - 1 and 2 the next.

So the solution is straightforward this way.

Only unique case is when k = 1, the result being a sequential series seems to be the most straightfoward answer.
