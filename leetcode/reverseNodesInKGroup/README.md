Reversing linked list, not hard at all.

Tried to do this again, very simple question but I debuged a while to get it pass the AC.\
The logic thinking is very important and I kinda see why facebook interviews this way.\
Should be able to run some tests and find problems.\
Also shouldn't make assumptions about what the input would look like.
