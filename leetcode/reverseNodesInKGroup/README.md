Reversing linked list, not hard at all.

3/20\
Tried to do this again, very simple question but I debuged a while to get it pass the AC.\
The logic thinking is very important and I kinda see why facebook interviews this way.\
Should be able to run some tests and find problems.\
Also shouldn't make assumptions about what the input would look like.

Rewrite the solution in recursive way, avoid using stack.\
The reverse linked list part took a while to get right, so basic but hard to\
write it very elegantly.
